# Use this script to find accuracy once the full exploration has been done on relevant scale factors.
# NOTE: The ground truth labels are in [1, 1000].
# 		Resnet outputs labels in [0,1000] -- class 0 is extraneous and is the other category.
# 		For DenseNet and SqueezeNet, the labels after argmax are in [0,999]:
# 			so either we have to do ground truth labels-1 or while outputing from the code for SqNet/DenseNet,
# 			add a +1. Choosing to go with the former.
# 		So, in summary, when running resnet, use the last parameter as 1, while for SqueezeNet/DenseNet use it as 0.
